  Abstract                 = { Define the riskiness of a gamble as the reciprocal of the absolute risk aversion (ARA) of an individual with constant ARA who is indifferent between taking and not taking that gamble. We characterize this index by axioms, chief among them a “duality” axiom that, roughly speaking, asserts that less risk‐averse individuals accept riskier gambles. The index is positively homogeneous, continuous, and subadditive; respects first‐ and second‐order stochastic dominance; and for normally distributed gambles is half of variance/mean. Examples are calculated, additional properties are derived, and the index is compared with others. }

Sci. 176, 200-217 (1992; Zbl 0766.60079)] they noted that these BSDE's provide a probabilistic formula for the solutions of certain classes of systems of quasilinear parabolic partial differential equations (PDE's) of second order, and are naturally associated with viscosity solutions of such PDE's. This paper generalizes the above results to the case of BSDE's with respect to both independent Brownian motion and Poisson random measure. The associate system of parabolic PDE's is then a system of integro-partial differential equations. Under smooth assumptions the BSDE is proved to have a unique solution. Then in a Markovian framework, some function defined from the solution of the BSDE is the unique viscosity solution of the system of integro-partial differential equations.}},

  Abstract                 = {{<P>This book is designed as a text for graduate courses in stochastic processes. It is written for readers familiar with measure-theoretic probability and discrete-time processes who wish to explore stochastic processes in continuous time. The vehicle chosen for this exposition is Brownian motion, which is presented as the canonical example of both a martingale and a Markov process with continuous paths. In this context, the theory of stochastic integration and stochastic calculus is developed. The power of this calculus is illustrated by results concerning representations of martingales and change of measure on Wiener space, and these in turn permit a presentation of recent advances in financial economics (option pricing and consumption/investment optimization). </P> <P>This book contains a detailed discussion of weak and strong solutions of stochastic differential equations and a study of local time for semimartingales, with special emphasis on the theory of Brownian local time. The text is complemented by a large number of problems and exercises.</P>}},

  Abstract                 = {This paper provides an axiomatic basis for a representation of personal preferences in which the utility of an act can be expressed as an expected value of conditional utilities of the act given any set of mutually exclusive and exhaustive scenarios, under a unique subjective probability. The representation is general enough to incorporate state-dependent utilities and/or utilities with dependencies across states, as, for example, in the case of disappointment aversion. More generally, this is a model incorporating subjective probability and subjective consequences, since neither probabilities nor consequences are included among its primitives. The model reduces to subjective expected utility under the additional assumptions of separability and state-independence with respect to an objective state-contingent structure of acts.Journal of Economic LiteratureClassification Numbers: D81, D84.},

  Abstract                 = {Abstract&nbsp;&nbsp;Existence and uniqueness results of the solution to fully coupled forward-backward stochastic differential equations with Brownian motion and Poisson process are obtained. Many stochastic Hamilton systems arising in stochastic optimal control systems with random jump and in mathematical finance with security price discontinuously changing can be treated with these results. The continuity of the solution depending on parameters is also proved in this paper.},
