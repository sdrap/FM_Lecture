## 1. Datatypes, Control Flows, Functions

!!! note
    For the following short exercises, no use of `numpy`.


1.1 Using conditional statements and loops, count the number of numbers between 0 and 10.000 which are divisible by 3 or 7 and print it.

1.2 Write a program that print the following pattern

ooooooooooooooooo                                                       
ooooooooooooooooo                                                       
oooo                                                                    
oooo                                                                    
oooo                                                                    
ooooooooooooooooo                                                       
ooooooooooooooooo                                                       
ooooooooooooooooo                                                       
             oooo                                                       
             oooo                                                       
             oooo                                                       
ooooooooooooooooo                                                       
ooooooooooooooooo                                                       
ooooooooooooooooo
```

1.3 Given a list `["apple", "orange", "cabage", "lemon", "potato"]` extract the subarray containing cabage and potato, and return their indices in the original list. Furthermore, write a program that inverse the order of the list.

1.5 Write a function that takes as input one of the name of the 12 month and return the number of days of this month (february is 28)

1.6 Write a function that takes a list of numbers and return a ordered list. i.e. `[1, 4, 2] -> [1, 2, 4]`. You can test this function by creating arbitraty list from numpy arrays `x = list(np.random.rand(N)`.


## 2. Numpy

2.1 Using `numpy` and its functionalities redo the exercises 1.1 and 1.6

2.2 Create two arrays of numbers between -1 and 1. The first one has consecutive numbers equally spaced by 0.01 while the second one has exactly 100 elements.

2.3 Given natural numbers $n$ and $d$, create a $n\times d$ matrix of the form

```py
[
    [0, 1, ..., d-1],
    [d, d+1, ..., 2d-1]
    ...
    [(n-1)d,...,(nd) -1 ]
]
```

!!! note
    There are several ways to do it, but remember that loops are not efficient in python.
    Have a look at the shape manipulations in `numpy`.


2.4 Create a 10x10 matrix where each line contains all the numbers 0 to 9 but shuffled uniformly randomly (check the random routines of numpy documentation)

2.5 Normalize a random 5x5 matrix such that the smallest element is 0 and largest is 1

2.6 Round a random array 5x5 with two digits after the coma

2.7 Given a random array 100 find the position and value of the closest element to 0.6

2.8 Write a function which given an array of size $N$ of integers between 0 and 10 returns the histogram of the array by bins of 0.1 (that is number of elements between 0 and 0.1, number of elements between 0.1 and 0.2, ..., between 0.9 and 1


## 3. Numpy and Plotly: *Collatz Conjecture*

!!! info "**Collatz Conjecture**"
    
    Consider the following sequence $u = (u_i)$ of natural numbers given by
    
    $$
    \begin{equation}
    u_{i+1} =
    \begin{cases}
    u_i /2 & \text{if }u_i \text{ is even}\\
    3u_i + 1 & \text{if }u_i \text{ is odd}
    \end{cases}
    \end{equation}
    $$
    
    starting with a number $u_0 = n \in \mathbb{N}$.
    
    The **Collatz Conjecture** states that whatever starting integer $n \in \mathbb{N}$, the sequence will ultimately reach after some time $1$.
    This Conjecture is still an open problem, some partial answer in this direction given recently by Terence Tao in 2019.
    
    For $n \in \mathbb{N}$, denote by
    
    $$
    \tau(n) : = \inf\{i \colon u_i = 1\}
    $$
    
    which representes the first time where the sequence starting form $n$ reaches $1$.
    If this sequence never reaches $1$ starting with $n$, then $\tau(n) = \infty$.
    Collatz conjecture states that $\tau(n)<\infty$ for every $n$.

    There is strong confidence that this conjecture is true, and empirically, it holds for every natural number smaller than $2^{68}$


3.1 Using the control flow `while`, given an integer $n$ write a function that returns a `numpy` array $(u_0, u_i, \ldots, u_{\tau(n)})$. Mathematically, also write what is the domain and codomain of this function.

3.2 Using `plotly`, provide a function where given a `numpy` array $x = (n_0, \ldots, n_{d-1})$ it plots $d$ paths $(u_0, \ldots, u_{\tau(n_k)})$ where $u_0 = n_k$ for $k=0, \ldots, d-1$.

3.4 Write a third function where given a `numpy` array $x = (1, ldots, d)$ it returns the array $(\tau(1), \ldots, \tau(d))$.

3.5 Using `bar` ploting functionality (`fig.add_bar(...)`) of `plotly`, write a function that plot the histogram of the previous function, that is $(l_1, l_2, \ldots)$ where

$$
\begin{equation}
l_k = \text{Cardinality}\{n\colon \tau(n) = k, \quad 0\leq n \leq N\}
\end{equation}
$$

for (depending on the performance of your computer) $N=1000, 10000, 100000$.

## 4. Scipy


4.1 Consider the function $x \mapsto f(x) = x ** 2 + 10 * sin(x)$ for $x \in \mathbb{R}$

* plot the function
* find the minimum

4.2 For the following distributions:

* normal with std = 1, 2, 5
* student with degree of freedom 2, 3, 4, 6
    
Plot the pdf and cdf of each class for different parameters and compare
